- Integrate with existing development environments (VSCode, terminal, web)
- Support multiple programming languages and project types

### 3. Privacy and Security First
- Comprehensive secret redaction to protect sensitive information
- Team-based access control and data isolation
- Local-first architecture with optional cloud sync

### 4. Incremental Value
- Provide immediate value from first use
- Progressive enhancement as knowledge base grows
- Optional features that don't interfere with core functionality

### 5. Developer-Centric Design
- Built by developers for developers
- Command-line first with web visualization
- Transparent operation with full debugging capabilities
