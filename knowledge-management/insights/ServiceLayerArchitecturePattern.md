# ServiceLayerArchitecturePattern

## Overview

**Problem:** Direct API calls from components create tight coupling and poor error handling

**Solution:** Service layer with file system caching and graceful fallbacks

**Implementation:** Node.js server with .timeline-cache/, mock data fallback, git/spec service wrappers

**Significance:** Extracted from Timeline project semantic analysis

## Benefits

- Loose coupling
- Graceful degradation
- Centralized error handling
