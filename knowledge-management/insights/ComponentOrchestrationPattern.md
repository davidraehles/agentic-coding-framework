# ComponentOrchestrationPattern

## Overview

**Problem:** Complex component interactions in large React applications become unmanageable without clear coordination

**Solution:** Implement orchestrator components that manage child component interactions and data flow

**Implementation:** TimelineVisualization orchestrates TimelineScene, TimelineEvents, ViewportFilteredEvents with clear props flow

**Significance:** Extracted from Timeline project semantic analysis

## Benefits

- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable component communication
- Easier testing and debugging
