# CompoundComponentPattern

## Overview

**Problem:** Related components need to share state without prop drilling or complex context setup

**Solution:** Create compound components that work together as a cohesive unit with implicit state sharing

**Implementation:** TimelineScene + TimelineAxis + TimelineEvents work as cohesive unit with shared 3D context

**Significance:** Extracted from Timeline project semantic analysis

## Benefits

- Flexible composition
- Implicit state sharing
- Better encapsulation
