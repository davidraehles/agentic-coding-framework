# CustomHookExtractionPattern

## Overview

**Problem:** Duplicated stateful logic across multiple components leads to maintenance issues

**Solution:** Extract common logic into reusable custom hooks with TypeScript support

**Implementation:** useViewportFiltering, useTimelineAnimation, useCameraControl hooks encapsulate complex logic

**Significance:** Extracted from Timeline project semantic analysis

## Benefits

- DRY principle
- Reusable stateful logic
- Full TypeScript support
