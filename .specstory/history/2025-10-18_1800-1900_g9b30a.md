At present, this is based on a multi-agent system which tries to extract semantic knowledge from a repository as well as the chat history (.specstory/history). Use serena to understand the existing code as well as the documentations, incl. the docs of the integrated mcp servers which are used in this, eg. semantic analysis, etc.).

**User Message:** to answer your questions: \
     │ 1. Scope: Should we focus on coding project only, or all teams (raas, ui, resi)?                                          │
