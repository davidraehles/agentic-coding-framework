### User

the documentation system is too elaborate (too many md files, potential overlap) - no one will ever read all of this. Make a plan for streamlining the documentation. We want:\
- everything accessible from the main README.md (coding)\
- all integrations also accessible from the main README.md (pointing to the main README.md of each integration)\
- there are only but a handful top-level concepts (health system (with dashboard), lsl, trajectories, constraints (with dashboards), knowledge-management (manual and online & ontologies, incl. vkb viewer), mcp-integrations). Consequently, there should be this many md-files that present a concise overview incl. architecture of what this topic is about, how it works.\
- in addition, there may be more comprehensive user manuals (one or more per topic)\
- the documentation folder shall be clear and well structured\
- presentation diagrams need updated once the docs have been restructured and cleaned-up (from things that are deprecated -> use serena to check everything vs. the codebase. If you find gaps/outdated docs... fix)

## CONTENT CONSOLIDATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Create 6 Concept Folders

1. **Create `docs/health-system/`**
   - Extract architecture sections from `enhanced-health-monitoring.md`, `monitoring-system.md`, `core-systems/health-verification.md`
   - Create concise `README.md` (architecture + how it works)
   - Optional: `dashboard-guide.md` for comprehensive usage

2. **Create `docs/lsl/`**
   - Keep `core-systems/live-session-logging.md` as source
   - Extract key sections for concise `README.md`
   - Optional: Full content as `user-manual.md`

3. **Create `docs/trajectories/`**
   - Merge `trajectory-generation-system.md` and `core-systems/trajectory-generation.md`
   - Create concise `README.md`

4. **Create `docs/constraints/`**
   - Keep `core-systems/constraint-monitoring.md` as source
   - Extract for concise `README.md`
   - Optional: `dashboard-guide.md`

5. **Reorganize `docs/knowledge-management/`**
   - Already well-structured, just consolidate:
     - Merge `ukb/` content into `ukb-guide.md`
     - Merge `vkb/` content into `vkb-guide.md`
     - Consolidate 5 ontology files into `ontology.md`

6. **Keep `docs/integrations/`**
   - Already well-structured
   - Just clean up redundant integration docs

### Phase 2: Restructure Main README.md

**New Structure**:
```markdown
# Coding - AI Development Toolkit

## Quick Start
[Installation commands]

## Core Capabilities (6 Systems)

### 1. Health System & Dashboard
[Brief description + link to docs/health-system/]

### 2. Live Session Logging (LSL)
[Brief description + link to docs/lsl/]

### 3. Trajectory Generation
[Brief description + link to docs/trajectories/]

### 4. Constraint Monitoring & Dashboard
[Brief description + link to docs/constraints/]

### 5. Knowledge Management (UKB/VKB/Ontologies)
[Brief description + link to docs/knowledge-management/]

### 6. MCP Integrations
[Brief description + link to docs/integrations/]

## Quick Links
- Getting Started: docs/getting-started.md
- Troubleshooting: docs/troubleshooting.md
- Reference: docs/reference/

## Integration Components
[Links to each integration's README.md]
- MCP Semantic Analysis → integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/
- MCP Constraint Monitor → integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/
- Serena AST → integrations/serena/
- Browser Access → integrations/browser-access/
- Health Dashboard → integrations/system-health-dashboard/
- VSCode CoPilot → integrations/vscode-km-copilot/
- Memory Visualizer → integrations/memory-visualizer/
```

### Phase 3: Delete Obsolete Content

**Files to delete**:
- Entire `docs/obsolete-invalid/` folder (8 files)
- `docs/enhanced-health-monitoring.md` (after merge)
- `docs/monitoring-system.md` (after merge)
- `docs/constraint-monitoring-system.md` (after merge)
- `docs/trajectory-generation-system.md` (after merge)
- `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` (consolidate into main)
- `docs/ukb/` folder (after merge)
- `docs/vkb/` folder (after merge)
- `docs/logging/` folder (after merge into LSL)
- `docs/components/` folder (after merge into integrations)

**Files to consolidate**:
- 5 ontology files → `knowledge-management/ontology.md`
- `multi-collection-classification.md` → section in knowledge-management
- `multi-team-setup.md` → section in knowledge-management

### Phase 4: Update Presentation Diagrams

**Diagrams needing updates** (based on new structure):
- `complete-system-overview.puml` → Update to show 6 core systems clearly
- `knowledge-architecture.puml` → Update with new ontology integration
- `monitoring-architecture.puml` → Update with health system architecture
- `system-architecture.puml` → Update to reflect new doc structure

**New diagrams to create**:
- `docs-navigation.puml` → Visual map of documentation structure
- `6-systems-overview.puml` → High-level view of 6 core capabilities

### Phase 5: Update All Cross-References

**Update links in**:
- All 6 concept README.md files → Link to each other appropriately
- Main README.md → Point to new structure
- docs/README.md → Update documentation index
- Integration READMEs → Point to new doc locations
- getting-started.md → Update paths

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After restructuring, verify:

- [ ] Main README.md is the clear central hub
- [ ] All 6 concepts have concise overview README.md
- [ ] All integrations accessible from main README → integration READMEs
- [ ] No broken links (run link checker)
- [ ] No duplicate content (search for similar headings)
- [ ] All obsolete files deleted
- [ ] Presentation diagrams reflect new structure
- [ ] Cross-references updated throughout

---

## IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

1. **Survey complete** ✅
2. **Create new folder structure** (6 concept folders)
3. **Extract/consolidate content** (create concise READMEs)
4. **Restructure main README.md** (central hub)
5. **Delete obsolete content** (obsolete-invalid + duplicates)
6. **Update presentation diagrams** (6-8 diagrams)
7. **Fix all cross-references** (automated link checking)
8. **Verify with checklist** (final validation)

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**Before**: 85+ scattered markdown files, unclear navigation, lots of overlap
**After**: ~40-50 focused files, 6 clear concepts, single entry point

**File Reduction**:
- Delete: ~25 files (obsolete + duplicates)
- Consolidate: ~20 files (merge into concept READMEs)
- Keep/Reorganize: ~40 files (properly organized)

**Navigation Improvement**:
- 1 central hub (README.md)
- 6 clear top-level concepts
- Each concept: 1 concise README + optional detailed manual
- All integrations: Direct links to self-contained READMEs

This plan creates a documentation structure that is **actually navigable** and **actually gets read**.
