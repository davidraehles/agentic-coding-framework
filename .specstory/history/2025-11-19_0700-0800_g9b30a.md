# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities


### Assistant

I'll read the recent session logs to provide continuity. Let me start by checking the current project and finding the relevant session logs.

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Get current working directory"
}
```

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1",
  "description": "Find newest local session log"
}
```

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md 2>/dev/null | head -1",
  "description": "Find newest coding redirected log"
}
```

    24→I'm ready to help you search through the curriculum-alignment codebase. I understand the critical guidelines:
    25→
    26→- No parallel versions (no v2, v3, enhanced, etc.)
    27→- Always verify results before claiming success
    28→- Use standard tools for code modifications, not Serena MCP
    29→- Follow project-specific guidelines from CLAUDE.md
    30→
    31→I'm currently at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment` and can:
    32→
    33→- Use **Glob** for broad file pattern matching
    34→- Use **Grep** for searching file contents with regex
    35→- Use **Read** to examine specific file contents
    36→- Use **Bash** for file operations and directory exploration
    37→
    38→What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.

## Session Log Summary

### Recent Work Context

**Current Project:** curriculum-alignment  
**Most Recent Activity:** November 10, 2025 (08:22 CEST)

### Key Findings:

#### 1. **Local Session (Oct 23, 2025)**
- **Classification:** Semantic similarity analysis shows this is nano-degree related content (0.362), though logged in curriculum-alignment
- **Activity:** Simple warmup session confirming readiness to work
- **Status:** Claude confirmed understanding of critical guidelines (no parallel versions, verification requirements, proper tool usage)

#### 2. **Coding Redirected Session (Nov 10, 2025 - 0800-0900)**
- **Activity:** User requested documentation update to reflect a fix/change
- **Type:** Text-only exchange with no tool execution recorded
- **Duration:** Brief exchange (~60 minute window)
- **Status:** Incomplete - the documentation update request appears unresolved

### Current State:

**Outstanding Work:** The most recent request to "update the docs to reflect this fix/change" from November 10th appears to need completion. However, without context about what specific fix/change was made, I would need more information to proceed with that documentation update.

**Repository Status:** 
- Modified file: `.specstory/logs/classification/classification-status_g9b30a.md`
- Untracked file: `.specstory/logs/classification/2025-11-10_0800-0900_g9b30a.jsonl`
- Recent commits show LSL documentation work and classification status updates

How would you like to proceed? Do you want to continue with the documentation update from the previous session, or is there something else you'd like to work on?
