### Text Exchange - 2025-10-25 17:06:51 UTC [19:06:51 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Message:** when you study this diagram, you get the feeling that the orchestrator agent only orchestrates between two of the 11 agents and that only the "semantic" agent uses LLMs and that the "sync" agent somehow does something with the persistent storage systems. It also still appears to be using the MCP memory server... which, I believe, we removed? And what are "files"? And are all other agents just calling one another in a sequence (without the coordinator getting involved)? This sounds majorly wrong....

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
