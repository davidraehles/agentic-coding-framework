# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If 2 is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

### Assistant

I'll read the last 2 session logs from both local and coding project histories to provide continuity.

### Assistant

Based on the session logs analysis, here's the session continuity summary:

## Session Log Summary (Last 2 Sessions)

**Current Project:** coding (git@cc-github.bmwgroup.net:frankwoernle/claude.git)  
**Primary Work Context:** Live session logging (LSL) implementation and CLAUDE.md consolidation

### Latest Session (1000-1100, Sept 26):
- **Focus:** Live session logging system testing
- **Status:** Session appears to have had some bash command errors early on
- **Key Activity:** Repeated `/sl` command executions with failed bash operations

### Previous Session (0900-1000, Sept 26):
- **Focus:** Session logging continuity and CLAUDE.md file consolidation
- **Major Accomplishment:** Successfully consolidated multiple CLAUDE configuration files
- **Key Actions:**
  - Consolidated 5 separate CLAUDE.md files from `/Users/q284340/Documents/CLAUDE/`
  - Created unified CLAUDE.md with global rules and project-specific sections
  - Successfully moved old files to backup directory
  - Completed all consolidation tasks as verified

### Cross-Project Context:
- No recent cross-project sessions found (last were from nano-degree project on Sept 4)
- Current work is focused entirely within the coding project

### Current State Awareness:
- CLAUDE.md files have been consolidated successfully
- Live Session Logging (LSL) system is active but had some command execution issues in the most recent session
- Working in the main coding project environment with proper MCP services expected to be available

The primary accomplishment from recent work was the successful consolidation of CLAUDE configuration files, creating a single unified guideline document with global rules and project-specific sections.

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.

**Result:** ✅ Success

On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 28 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .gitignore
	modified:   .global-lsl-registry.json
	modified:   .specstory/history/2025-09-26_0900-1000_g9b30a.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.specstory/history/2025-09-26_1000-1100_g9b30a.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

### Assistant

Perfect! I've successfully:

1. **Added `.global-lsl-registry.json` to `.gitignore`** - placed it in the "Live logging runtime data" section alongside other LSL-related files
2. **Removed it from the staging area** - used `git restore --staged` to unstage the file

The git status now shows `.global-lsl-registry.json` as a modified file that's not staged for commit, and it will be ignored in future git operations due to the `.gitignore` entry.

the .global-lsl-registry.json is still in the current git tracked change set - remove it from there

### Assistant

You're right - the file is still being tracked by git. I need to remove it from git's tracking entirely.

### Assistant

### Assistant

Perfect! Now `.global-lsl-registry.json` has been properly removed from git tracking. The file is:

1. **Staged for deletion** - it will be removed from the repository when you commit
2. **Added to `.gitignore`** - so it won't be tracked in the future
3. **Still exists locally** - but git will ignore it going forward

The current git status shows:
- `.global-lsl-registry.json` is staged for deletion (will be removed from repo)
- `.gitignore` is modified (contains the new ignore rule)
- Session history files are being tracked as expected
