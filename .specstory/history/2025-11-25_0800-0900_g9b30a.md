### Text Exchange - 2025-11-25 07:53:49 UTC [08:53:49 CEST]

**User Message:** Seems that we only have a percentage on X... and you are missing an Anthropic key (A) despite my .env file having valid keys for all providers. Plus, what is the letter for Groq? (G?) and how will we separate this from <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>/Gemini (G?).\
Also, the dashboard suggests that there are no API providers... and there still is a stale status (which we fixed yesterday, alledgedly): [Image #1]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
