### Text Exchange - 2025-11-24 18:17:40 UTC [19:17:40 CEST]

**User Message:** why 3001 now, not 8080?! we have a .env.ports file that defines where stuff shall be. ultrathink. Restore the graph (from git, if you must) to get back to the working state. When deleting an entity (from coding, presumably), coding appears to loose the connections to CollectiveKnowledge - as I explained before. Do you have proper logging/tracing established now to see where this failure comes from? use serena to understand the code. Fix

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
