### Text Exchange - 2025-10-25 15:04:29 UTC [17:04:29 CEST]

**User Message:** Enough. I want you to completely revamp the memory-visualizer. Analyze the existing codebase (coding/memory-visualizer) using serena. This is a standalone git repo. move it to integrations and refactor the code to follow the following requirements:\
- MVI architecture\
- Redux state management (avoid component local states using local hooks)\
- completely (!) remove all JSON-based data handling, i. e. no more loading from JSON, no screen for JSON uploads - the only data source is our graph DB\
-...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
