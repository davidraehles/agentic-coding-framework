### Text Exchange - 2025-10-20 11:12:22 UTC [13:12:22 CEST]

**User Message:** it's getting worse... [Image #1]. Batch mode and online mode look like this too, minus the doubled-up (unconnected) nodes. Debug this properly... you know what the JSON looked like to display 28 batch mode nodes and you know what the JSON looks like which you display just now. Find the differences. This should also show you how to establish a connection from a regular node to the central "CollectiveKnowledge" node, how the filtering via teams works... and why we have lost all batch nodes now... ...

**User Message:** no change - the TestOnlinePattern-to-CollectiveKnowledge line is still missing and you show both online and batch nodes in both combined (= correct) and batch mode (incorrect). ultrathink, use serena to understand the code. fix this. Can you not simply compare a batch node entry to TestOnlinePattern (in the final memory.json which you then use to display everything?)
