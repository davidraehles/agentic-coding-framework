### Text Exchange - 2025-11-30 10:55:53 UTC [11:55:53 CEST]

**User Message:** 11 seconds - sounds like no real update. Looking at coding.json... you just updated the timestamps (why?! should only update this when you also make a proper change to an item). Also, have you updated the graphology DB first (which should have triggered persistance in LevelDB which should have triggered this update in the JSON file)? Check the logs. If the logs don't tell you this, extend the code so that this is clearly observable. ultrathink, use serena to check the code.\
and find out, why it...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
