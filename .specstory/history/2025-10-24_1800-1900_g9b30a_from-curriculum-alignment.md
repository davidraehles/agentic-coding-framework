**User Message:** now this - don't forget that we want a single page presentation which is easy to consume (everything big enough to be read without zooming and scrolling) - we don't need notes\

**User Message:** you just created a nested presentation folder in coding/docs/puml - fix\
you also created png files in puml - they need to be moved to images and ALL their references need fixed.\

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-24 16:41:43 UTC [18:41:43 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Message:** where is this used? docs/images/actual-storage-architecture.png -->  seems incorrect/outdated - if there is no reference to this file (check ALL md's in coding!!) we can remove the png and puml.\
this is broken: docs/images/actual-knowledge-data-flow.png\
make a presentation version of this one too: docs/images/actual-component-architecture.png\
also broken: docs/images/monitoring-architecture.png\
