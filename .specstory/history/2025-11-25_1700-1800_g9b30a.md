**User Message:** health status is stale again - despite your previous efforts... and claims that this has been resolved and that the health dashboard would update automatically (periodically). In your previous analysis you said that the "health demon" wasn't running... how can this be? we have an elaborate global health monitoring system with watchdogs, etc. How come, we run into such issues time and time again?\
Also, why is the VV status red (old)? Should this not go black, like ND?\
