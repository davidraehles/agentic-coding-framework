## Key Activities

### Grep - 2025-10-27 05:49:23 UTC [06:49:23 CEST]

**User Request:** clicking a node selects it (as required) and makes the graph appear. It also draws a red circle around the node. However, this seems to only work on the first node. After that, the circle seems stuck on that node. Desired behavior:\
- the circle always indicates the currently seletect node. Also, when closing the node's details page, the circle should be removed.\
Also, move the statistics you display at the bottom of the left sidebar menu to above or below the main graph viewing area - at present you need to scroll to see them. Ensure that, on a normal screen, I don't need to scroll vertically to see all menus (currenly the case)

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "circle.*selected|selectNode|selectedNode",
  "path": "integrations/memory-visualizer/src/components",
  "glob": "**/*.tsx",
  "output_mode": "files_with_matches"
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error
