**User Message:** docs/images/lsl-architecture.png check this diagram using the associated puml and serena to understand it - are we really using Grok API (X.AI)... or is it Groq based modles that we use instead? Correct where necessary. Then derive a corresponding presentation version of this diagram with thicker lines, reduced amount of text and focussing on the essential details.. .presentations are mostly landscape (PPT) --> aim for a more horizontal layout without making it too wide (eg. in presentation mode...
