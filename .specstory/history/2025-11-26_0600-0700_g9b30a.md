### Text Exchange - 2025-11-26 05:52:56 UTC [06:52:56 CEST]

**User Message:** can you tell from the log files why this happened? Is there no mechanism in the global health monitor to check all needed demons (like processes, etc.)? And if it is found to be "not running" to re-launche it? Do we have comprehensive logs/traces that allow us to see when a needed service/demon/... goes down?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
