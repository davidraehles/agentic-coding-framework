**User Message:** clicking on some nodes still crashes the app entirely: [Image #1]. This happens in "online" mode when clicking on NetworkAwareInstallationPattern or ComprehensiveSemanticAnalysis (presumably any node will do in this filtering - also note that you still display light blue batch nodes which are not connected in this case: [Image #1]

  The database-first approach was being used for batch mode, which was wrong. Batch knowledge should ALWAYS come from
  JSON files (source of truth).\
Sounds wrong. High level, I'd say, we want to get rid of the JSON files going forward. A sound architecture would establish an interface/API which allows the viewer to get ALL needed data from the DB. Then move all JSON held data into the DB. This should be a migration script which can be run as often as wanted, merging the c...
