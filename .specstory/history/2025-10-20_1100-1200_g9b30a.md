### Text Exchange - 2025-10-20 09:19:21 UTC [11:19:21 CEST]

**User Message:** now we only see online nodes (should this not be one? Are you counting the project and system nodes too? Doesn't really make sense): [Image #1] - note... this is shown in all modes (batch, online, combined). Selecting a different team gets us back to the load JSON screen: [Image #2]. The TestOnlinePattern node is still blue, not red

**User Message:** we're still missing the line from TestOnlinePattern to CollectiveKnowledge. And you now made the Project node red (wrong). Where is this coming from? Are you unsure what the agreed colors are? [Image #1] read the codebase of memory-visualizer and the JSON formats to find where you are missing the point (use serena). Also, we still have no more batch mode content - it's always this view
