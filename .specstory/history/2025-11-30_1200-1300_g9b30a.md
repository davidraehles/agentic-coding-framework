**User Message:** in the vkb viewer, you show me some history items as "new" (yet they have existed for ages) and others as "+ n obs" to indicate how many observations are in this node (or have just been added?). This came about when I asked you to indicated the changes you made.\
Expectation would be that "new" is only used when you just added a completely new node. + n obs is only used when you just included additional observations. find a way to show changes too and deletions or changed relations...\

Then fix this.\
(2) until a few moments ago this lo...
