**User Message:** what on earth made you conclude this? What bash tool? we literally JUST removed this bash command!!!!!!! Reason: you keep telling me that running some command "ukb" (just removed completely from the system... what information led you to believe there still is such a command? We need to remove this misleading info, so you don't think there is a ukb bash tool!!) ... at shell level we don't have access to the mcp server for semantic analysis. What should happeh: (1) I issue ukb at the claude prompt...
