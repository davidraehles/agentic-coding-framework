Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User opened `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/operations/knowledge-system-ops.md` and noted it mentions Grafana dashboards for viewing captured knowledge. User wants this information available in the VKB viewer instead, with online-learned nodes displayed in a different color t...

**User Message:** Warmup

**Assistant Response:** I'm ready and warmed up! I understand the critical guidelines from CLAUDE.md:

1. **NO PARALLEL VERSIONS** - Always edit originals, never create v2/v3/enhanced/temp variants
2. **MANDATORY VERIFICATION** - Always verify results with actual command output before claiming success
3. **SERENA MCP USAGE** - Only for code analysis/reading, never for modifications (use Edit/Write tools instead)
4. **NO FALLBACK PATTERNS** - Keep single clear data sources, throw errors on inconsistency
5. **Project-spe...

**User Message:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ...

**User Message:** are there any online learned items in the knowledge base? When trying to display this with the vkb viewer, I don't seem to get anything... could be that I need to restart the server first (I did quit this session and restarted coding/bin/coding, but there were two other sessions which kept running... so maybe the system is still on the old server instance?)\
