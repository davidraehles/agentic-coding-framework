# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Check current working directory"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | grep -v \"_from-\" | head -5",
  "description": "List recent local coding sessions"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
.specstory/history/2025-11-22_2100-2200_g9b30a.md
.specstory/history/2025-11-22_2000-2100_g9b30a.md

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Glob
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "docs/**/*.puml"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/docs/puml/mcp-server-architecture.puml",
  "old_string": "package \"External Services\" <<external>> {\n  cloud [Custom LLM] as CUSTOM_LLM <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [Anthropic Claude] as ANTHROPIC <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [OpenAI GPT] as OPENAI <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [Web Search APIs] as WEB_API <<external>>\n  database [Git Repository] as GIT_REPO <<storage>>\n  database [.specstory/history] as VIBE_FILES <<storage>>\n}",
  "new_string": "package \"External Services\" <<external>> {\n  cloud [Groq LLM] as GROQ_LLM <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [Gemini] as GEMINI <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [Custom LLM] as CUSTOM_LLM <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [Anthropic Claude] as ANTHROPIC <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [OpenAI GPT] as OPENAI <<external>> #FFE6E6\n  cloud [Web Search APIs] as WEB_API <<external>>\n  database [Git Repository] as GIT_REPO <<storage>>\n  database [.specstory/history] as VIBE_FILES <<storage>>\n}"
}
```

3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/docs/puml/mcp-server-architecture.puml",
  "old_string": "note right of SEMANTIC\n  3-tier LLM provider chain:\n  Custom LLM → Anthropic → OpenAI\n  Correlates code changes with conversations\n  Deep semantic code analysis\nend note",

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "plantuml docs/puml/mcp-server-architecture.puml",
  "description": "Generate PNG from PlantUML"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |

Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |

| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/README.md",
  "offset": 145,
  "limit": 20
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
   145→### Prerequisites
   146→- Node.js 18+ 
   147→- API keys for LLM providers (Anthropic recommended, OpenAI optional)

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

```

**Result:** ✅ Success

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Glob
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "docs/**/*.md"

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax

- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/docs/architecture/agents.md",
  "old_string": "### 10. DeduplicationAgent\n**Purpose**: Semantic duplicate detection and removal\n\n**Key Capabilities**:\n- Identifies semantic duplicates\n- Merges similar insights\n- Reduces redundancy\n- Maintains unique knowledge\n\n**Location**: `src/agents/deduplication.ts`",
  "new_string": "### 10.

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives
