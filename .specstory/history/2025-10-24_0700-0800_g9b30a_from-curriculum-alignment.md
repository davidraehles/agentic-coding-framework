## Key Activities

### TodoWrite - 2025-10-24 05:12:22 UTC [07:12:22 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** For presentation purposes, I want to use the plantuml diagrams from the documentation of project coding. However, the lines are too faint and the fontsize too small for a presentation. Also, the information displayed in each element can be reduced to not overload the diagram in the presentation. Create new folders coding/docs/presentation/puml and coding/docs/presentation/images. Copy coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml to coding/docs/presentation/puml/_presentation-style.puml and adjust it to improve readability in presentations. Then re-create file /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/architecture/cross-project-knowledge.md in coding/presentation/puml making sure it uses the presentation styling and reduced information to (eg just the name/title in each box/element, no "shoutout" comments, etc. - the layout should consider that we mostly present in landscape and everything needs to fit on one page.

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create presentation directory structure",
      "activeForm": "Creating presentation directories",
      "status": "in_progress"
    },
    {
      "content": "Copy and adapt standard style to presentation style",
      "activeForm": "Adapting standard style for presentations",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create simplified presentation version of cross-project-knowledge-flow diagram",
      "activeForm": "Creating simplified presentation diagram",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "content": "Generate PNG from presentation PlantUML",
      "activeForm": "Generating presentation PNG",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "content": "Verify presentation diagram fits on one page",
      "activeForm": "Verifying diagram layout",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
