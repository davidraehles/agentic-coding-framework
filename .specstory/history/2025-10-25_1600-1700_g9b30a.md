### Text Exchange - 2025-10-25 14:18:17 UTC [16:18:17 CEST]

**User Message:** doesn't do what you say:\
- Radio button shows "Online" but displays batch (blue) nodes = BUG WAS REAL ✅ NOW FIXED\
even after a hard reload, all nodes are shown in online, none in batch (= wrong way round). Fix this - add log messages to allow us to debug this... you've been trying way too long without any success. Also, create an artificial online entry (TestOnlinePattern) in the DB to allow us testing the Online functionality.

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
