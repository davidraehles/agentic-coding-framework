**User Message:** it's gone - I checked. However, will I always have to stop the vkb server to allow for changes to the knowledge-base? This would be tedious and prone to fail almost always... (lock to leveDB)

**User Message:** it seems that you destroyed the content of resi.json - it's almost empty now... see the git change set to see what it looked like. I suspect a problem in your scripts - this should not happen... didn't you just make a simple change to see if it propagates through to the DBs?
