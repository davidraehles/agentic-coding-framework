### Text Exchange - 2025-10-20 16:02:59 UTC [18:02:59 CEST]

**User Message:** so, batch and combined seem to work (colors, relationships/lines and also wrt. filtering on teams). One small issue is that, everytime we change the team filtering, it jumps to combined - would be better to have both filterings (teams vs. batch/online/combined) separate and not impact one another.\
Bigger issue is that the online only view only shows the TestOnlinePattern node (no CollectiveKnowledge and no Coding as containing project... nor any lines, of course)

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
