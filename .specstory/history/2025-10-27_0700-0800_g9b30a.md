## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:05:55 UTC [07:05:55 CEST]

**User Message:** the text filtering seems somewhat impaired in that, with every additional letter I type, I get fewer and fewer relations (lines). Also, the central node (CollectiveKnowledge) and a node's project must always remain visible. The filterning shall only work on nodes other than the system node and the projects [Image #1]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:08:02 UTC [07:08:02 CEST]

**User Message:** better, but you keep ALL projects - that's wrong. Only the projects related to a visible node must be shown (always the case - not just in text filtering) [Image #1]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:12:36 UTC [07:12:36 CEST]

**User Message:** when using the text filter highlight the found match (in the graph as well as in the details page, so we see why a node is selected by this pattern

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:16:53 UTC [07:16:53 CEST]

**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation, which is a continuation from a previous session about the Memory Visualizer application.

## Message 1: User requests legend to be moved to top of graph
User stated: "move the legend to the top of the graph too, to make more room for the menues"

**My Actions**:
1. Initially misunderstood - I ADDED a new legend to ...

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:20:06 UTC [07:20:06 CEST]

**User Message:** why are the projects shown, despite the number of associated insights nodes having dropped to zero? [Image #1]\
(this came about during text filtering - maybe you first had some nodes that matched, but as we typed more and more letters, nodes disappeared (as they no longer matched), but you failed to remove the project when the last of its insight nodes got removed)\
Also, there is no need to circle insight nodes that include a match (in the graph) - the circle shall only be used to indicate whi...

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:24:46 UTC [07:24:46 CEST]

**User Message:** deactivate the autoscaling we introduced - it makes the display become to jerky

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:27:22 UTC [07:27:22 CEST]

**User Message:** filters Entity Type and Relation Type only have one possible selection (All) - analyze and fix

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 06:31:04 UTC [07:31:04 CEST]

**User Message:** the filtering by relationship type fails to remove nodes which are not connected to anything: [Image #1]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all the key details:

## Chronological Analysis:

### Message 1: User reports Project node filtering issue
User showed a screenshot where Project nodes (Coding) remain visible despite no insight nodes matching "testingw". The user explained this happened during text filtering - as they typed more letters,...

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Check current working directory"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",

2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-10-27_0700-0800_g9b30a.md"
