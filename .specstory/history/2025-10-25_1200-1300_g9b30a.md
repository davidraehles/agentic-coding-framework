### Text Exchange - 2025-10-25 10:52:18 UTC [12:52:18 CEST]

**User Message:** doesn't work [Image #1] - the UI projects (DynArch, Timeline) are missing now. Still no online TestOnlinePattern. Everyhting shows as online (radiobutton filter) but then as light-blue (= batch/ukb mode, not online... which they are). Fix this systematically by debugging what you get from the DB (via log messages) - do you have an online node called "TestOnlinePattern"? Are all other nodes "batch"? What projects do you have? - find the mistakes that I keep telling you about and positively verify...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Message:** this is garbage!!!!!!!\
  The GraphDB at .data/knowledge-graph/ is completely empty (0 entities). This explains:
  - Missing UI projects (DynArch, Timeline)
  - Missing TestOnlinePattern
  - Everything showing as batch (because there's no online data)\
You should know where the data is coming from!! You programmed this!! Check the code to see where it is loading from. If you have actually lost all data in the DB now, you can recreated it from the shared-memory*.json file you should still be able...
