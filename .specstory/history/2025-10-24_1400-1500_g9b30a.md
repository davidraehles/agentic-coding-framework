**User Request:** I need to understand why team filtering isn't working in the VKB frontend. The sidebar shows only "Resi" selected, but the graph displays ALL nodes from all teams (coding, ui, resi).

Please investigate:
1. In memory-visualizer/src/components/KnowledgeGraphVisualization.tsx, find the getFilteredData function
2. Check how it filters entities and relations based on selectedTeams
3. Look for where the graph is rendered and how it uses the filtered data
4. Find any code that should be filtering nodes by team but isn't working

Focus on the filtering logic and why it's not removing nodes when teams are deselected.

**User Request:** I need to understand how node colors are determined in the VKB frontend. The issue is that all nodes are showing as light red (online/auto) when they should be light blue (batch/manual).

Please investigate:
1. In memory-visualizer/src/components/KnowledgeGraphVisualization.tsx, find where node colors are assigned in the D3 visualization
2. Find the getNodeColor function or similar color mapping logic
3. Check how metadata.source is used to determine colors
4. Look for any code that sets fill color based on source='batch' vs source='online'

**User Request:** I need to understand how node colors are determined in the VKB frontend. The issue is that all nodes are showing as light red (online/auto) when they should be light blue (batch/manual).

Please investigate:
1. In memory-visualizer/src/components/KnowledgeGraphVisualization.tsx, find where node colors are assigned in the D3 visualization
2. Find the getNodeColor function or similar color mapping logic
3. Check how metadata.source is used to determine colors
4. Look for any code that sets fill color based on source='batch' vs source='online'

Focus on finding the actual D3 code that assigns fill colors to nodes.

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "source === 'online'|source === 'batch'|metadata.*source|_source.*database",
  "path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/memory-visualizer/src/components/KnowledgeGraphVisualization.tsx",

**User Request:** I need to understand how node colors are determined in the VKB frontend. The issue is that all nodes are showing as light red (online/auto) when they should be light blue (batch/manual).

Please investigate:
1. In memory-visualizer/src/components/KnowledgeGraphVisualization.tsx, find where node colors are assigned in the D3 visualization
2. Find the getNodeColor function or similar color mapping logic
3. Check how metadata.source is used to determine colors
4. Look for any code that sets fill color based on source='batch' vs source='online'

Focus on finding the actual D3 code that assigns fill colors to nodes.

**Tool:** Read

  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/memory-visualizer/src/api/databaseClient.ts"

**User Request:** I need to understand how node colors are determined in the VKB frontend. The issue is that all nodes are showing as light red (online/auto) when they should be light blue (batch/manual).

Please investigate:
1. In memory-visualizer/src/components/KnowledgeGraphVisualization.tsx, find where node colors are assigned in the D3 visualization
2. Find the getNodeColor function or similar color mapping logic
3. Check how metadata.source is used to determine colors
4. Look for any code that sets fill color based on source='batch' vs source='online'

Focus on finding the actual D3 code that assigns fill colors to nodes.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/memory-visualizer/src/api/databaseClient.ts"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
