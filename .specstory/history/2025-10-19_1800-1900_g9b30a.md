### Text Exchange - 2025-10-19 16:28:28 UTC [18:28:28 CEST]

**User Message:** the display in online or both is broken: online shows batch learned content (although not all of it... maybe only focussing on team coding, not UI - configuration is both teams). The "both" mode has redundand nodes from batch learning which are not connected... plus a second "green" node (there can only be one): [Image #1]\
Are there any online learned concepts in the DB? Why the MCP memory? Is it not in Qdrant?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Message:** why do you look in sqlite DB? you just told me it's in the MCP memory... ultrathink, use serena to understand documentation and codebase, then check the DB in which the online system persists it's findings/concepts

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User ran `/sl` command to read session logs for continuity. I read the most recent session logs and provided a summary showing:
   - VKB server enhancement needed (display online-learned nodes)
   - Test failures in nano-degree project
   - Knowledge extraction E2E tests failing

2. **User'...

**User Message:** display still broken: [Image #1] - and move the legend to the top right (takes up too much vertical space). What API authentication error needs fixing? ultrathink, use serena to investigate the codebase. Then fix this
