# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create deployment guide markdown file",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Creating deployment guide markdown file"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create detailed architecture PlantUML diagram",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Creating detailed architecture PlantUML diagram"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create overview architecture PlantUML diagram",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Creating overview architecture PlantUML diagram"
    },
    {
      "content": "Generate PNG files from PlantUML",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Generating PNG files from PlantUML"
    },
    {
      "content": "Update README.md with link to guide and overview diagram",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Updating README.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable
```

  "content": "# AWS Deployment Guide\n\nThis guide walks you through deploying the UI Template application to AWS with multi-environment support (dev, int, prod).\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n![Architecture Diagram](images/aws-architecture.png)\n\nThe application uses a serverless architecture with:\n\n- **CloudFront** - CDN for static assets and API routing\n- **S3** - Static website hosting for the React frontend\n- **API Gateway** - REST API with Cognito authorization\n- **Lambda** - Serverless API handler\n- **Cognito** - User authentication and authorization\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed:\n\n### Required Tools\n\n1. **AWS CLI** (v2.x)\n   ```bash\n   # macOS\n   brew install awscli\n\n   # Verify installation\n   aws --version\n   ```\n\n2. **AWS SAM CLI** (v1.100+)\n   ```bash\n   # macOS\n   brew install aws-sam-cli\n\n   # Verify installation\n   sam --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Node.js** (v20+)\n   ```bash\n   # Using nvm (recommended)\n   nvm install 20\n   nvm use 20\n\n   # Verify installation\n   node --version\n   ```\n\n4. **Git** (for CI/CD)\n   ```bash\n   git --version\n   ```\n\n### AWS Account Setup\n\n1. **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions\n2. **IAM User/Role**: Create an IAM user with the following permissions:\n   - `AWSLambda_FullAccess`\n   - `AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator`\n   - `AmazonS3FullAccess`\n   - `CloudFrontFullAccess`\n   - `AmazonCognitoPowerUser`\n   - `IAMFullAccess` (for creating roles)\n   - `CloudFormationFullAccess`\n\n3. **Configure AWS CLI**:\n   ```bash\n   aws configure\n   # Enter your AWS Access Key ID\n   # Enter your AWS Secret Access Key\n   # Default region: eu-central-1\n   # Default output format: json\n   ```\n\n## Deployment Methods\n\n### Method 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended for First Time)\n\n#### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\n# Install frontend dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Install Lambda dependencies\ncd lambda/api\nnpm install\ncd ../..\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Build the Application\n\n```bash\n# Build SAM application (Lambda functions)\nsam build\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Deploy to Development Environment\n\n```bash\n# Deploy to dev (auto-confirms changes)\nsam deploy --config-env dev\n\n# Or use the npm script\nnpm run sam:deploy:dev\n```\n\n**Expected output**:\n```\nCloudFormation outputs from deployed stack\n------------------------------------------\nOutputs\n------------------------------------------\nKey                 ApiUrl\nDescription         API Gateway endpoint URL\nValue               https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> \\\n  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=<EMAIL_REDACTED> \\\n  --temporary-password \"TempPass123!\" \\\n  --message-action SUPPRESS\n\n# Set permanent password\naws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \\\n  --user-pool-id <UserPoolId> \\\n  --username <EMAIL_REDACTED> \\\n  --password \"YourSecurePassword123!\" \\\n  --permanent\n```\n\n### 2. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)\n\nTo use a custom domain instead of CloudFront's default URL:\n\n1. **Request/Import SSL Certificate** in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)\n   - Must be in `us-east-1` region for CloudFront\n\n2. **Update CloudFront Distribution**:\n   ```yaml\n   # Add to template.yaml CloudFrontDistribution\n   Aliases:\n     - your-domain.com\n   ViewerCertificate:\n     AcmCertificateArn: !Ref CertificateArn\n     SslSupportMethod: sni-only\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure DNS** (Route 53 or external):\n   - Create CNAME or Alias record pointing to CloudFront distribution\n\n### 3. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts\n\n```bash\n# Create CloudWatch alarm for API errors\naws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \\\n  --alarm-name \"ui-template-dev-api-errors\" \\\n  --metric-name \"5XXError\" \\\n  --namespace \"AWS/ApiGateway\" \\\n  --statistic Sum \\\n  --period 300 \\\n  --threshold 10 \\\n  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \\\n  --evaluation-periods 1 \\\n  --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=ui-template-api-dev\n```\n\n## Local Development\n\n### Running Locally (Without AWS)\n\n```bash\n# Start frontend dev server + local API server\nnpm run start\n\n# Or separately:\nnpm run dev      # Frontend only (http://localhost:5173)\nnpm run server   # Local API server (http://localhost:3030)\n```\n\n### Running Lambda Locally (With SAM)\n\n```bash\n# Start SAM local API\nnpm run sam:local\n\n# This starts Lambda on http://localhost:3001\n# Configure frontend to use this endpoint in .env\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n#### 1. SAM Build Fails\n\n```bash\n# Error: Unable to build NodeJS project\n# Solution: Ensure Node.js version matches Lambda runtime\nnode --version  # Should be v20.x\n\n# Clean and rebuild\nrm -rf .aws-sam\nsam build\n```\n\n#### 2. CloudFormation Stack Stuck\n\n```bash\n# Check stack events\naws cloudformation describe-stack-events \\\n  --stack-name ui-template-dev \\\n  --query 'StackEvents[?ResourceStatus==`CREATE_FAILED`]'\n\n# Delete and redeploy if needed\naws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ui-template-dev\nsam deploy --config-env dev\n```\n\n#### 3. CORS Errors in Browser\n\nCheck that:\n1. API Gateway CORS is configured correctly\n2. Lambda returns proper CORS headers\n3. CloudFront forwards the `Origin` header\n\n```bash\n# Test CORS\ncurl -I -X OPTIONS https://<api-url>/api/health \\\n  -H \"Origin: http://localhost:5173\" \\\n  -H \"Access-Control-Request-Method: GET\"\n```\n\n#### 4. Authentication Fails\n\n```bash\n# Verify Cognito configuration\naws cognito-idp describe-user-pool \\\n  --user-pool-id <UserPoolId>\n\n# Check client settings\naws cognito-idp describe-user-pool-client \\\n  --user-pool-id <UserPoolId> \\\n  --client-id <UserPoolClientId>\n```\n\n### Viewing Logs\n\n```bash\n# Lambda logs\naws logs tail /aws/lambda/ui-template-dev-api --follow\n\n# API Gateway logs\naws logs tail /aws/apigateway/ui-template-dev --follow\n```\n\n## Cleanup\n\nTo remove all deployed resources:\n\n```bash\n# Delete the CloudFormation stack\naws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ui-template-dev\n\n# Wait for deletion to complete\naws cloudformation wait stack-delete-complete --stack-name ui-template-dev\n\n# Repeat for other environments\naws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ui-template-int\naws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ui-template-prod\n```\n\n**Note**: S3 buckets with content must be emptied before stack deletion:\n\n```bash\naws s3 rm s3://<bucket-name> --recursive\n```\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Useful Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `npm run dev` | Start local dev server |\n| `npm run build` | Build frontend |\n| `npm run sam:build` | Build Lambda functions |\n| `npm run sam:local` | Run Lambda locally |\n| `npm run sam:deploy:dev` | Deploy to dev |\n| `npm run sam:deploy:int` | Deploy to int |\n| `npm run sam:deploy:prod` | Deploy to prod |\n\n### Stack Outputs\n\nAfter deployment, retrieve outputs:\n\n```bash\naws cloudformation describe-stacks \\\n  --stack-name ui-template-dev \\\n  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \\\n  --output table\n```\n\n### Environment URLs\n\n| Environment | URL Pattern |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| dev | `https://dXXXXXXXXXX.cloudfront.net` |\n| int | `https://dXXXXXXXXXX.cloudfront.net` |\n| prod | `https://dXXXXXXXXXX.cloudfront.net` |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Customize Authentication**: Add social login providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub)\n2. **Add API Routes**: Extend Lambda handler with your business logic\n3. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure CloudWatch dashboards and alarms\n4. **Configure WAF**: Add Web Application Firewall for security\n5. **Enable Backups**: Set up S3 versioning and DynamoDB backups\n"

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json

   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs/puml && plantuml -checkonly aws-architecture.puml 2>&1",
  "description": "Validate PlantUML syntax"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|

   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs/puml/architecture-overview.puml",
  "content": "@startuml architecture-overview\n!include _standard-style.puml\n\ntitle UI Template - Architecture Overview\n\nskinparam componentStyle rectangle\n\n' External\nactor \"User\" as user\n\n' Frontend\npackage \"Frontend\" {\n    component \"React App\" as react\n    component \"Redux Store\" as redux\n    component \"AWS Amplify\" as amplify\n}\n\n' AWS Services\ncloud \"AWS\" {\n    component \"CloudFront\" as cloudfront\n    component \"S3\" as s3\n    component \"API Gateway\" as apigw\n    component \"Lambda\" as lambda\n    component \"Cognito\" as cognito\n}\n\n' Connections\nuser --> cloudfront : HTTPS\n\ncloudfront --> s3 : Static Files\ncloudfront --> apigw : /api/*\n\napigw --> lambda : Invoke\napigw --> cognito : Auth\n\nreact --> redux : State\nreact --> amplify : Auth SDK\namplify --> cognito : Sign In/Up\n\ns3 --> react : Serve App\n\n@enduml\n"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
File created successfully at: /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs/puml/architecture-overview.puml

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create deployment guide markdown file",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Creating deployment guide markdown file"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create detailed architecture PlantUML diagram",
      "status": "completed",

      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Updating README.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "plantuml cicd-flow.puml && mv cicd-flow.png ../images/ && ls -la ../images/",
  "description": "Generate CI/CD flow PNG"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create deployment guide markdown file",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Creating deployment guide markdown file"
    },

**User Request:** Base directory for this skill: /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/skills/documentation-style

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs/puml/cicd-flow.puml"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion
