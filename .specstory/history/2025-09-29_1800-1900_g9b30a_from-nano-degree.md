make a new slash command ~/.claude/commands/restore.md with this content:\
# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

### Assistant

I'll create the restore slash command as specified.

### Assistant

The fw slash command has been created at `~/.claude/commands/fw.md` with the identical content as the restore command. Both commands will provide session continuity by reading and summarizing recent session logs from local and coding project histories.
