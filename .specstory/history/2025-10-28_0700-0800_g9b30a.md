**User Message:** '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/logs/classification/classification-status_g9b30a_from-coding.md' - it seems that the summary status of the classification logs is still created, even when nothing is done in any of the active coding agent sessions. Check this - we don't want any activity while the system is essentially unused (eg. overnight). It seems that you only updated the date/timestamp (which is a giveaway for non-activity). What might have triggered this is that I start...
