**User Message:** [Image #1] the colors are wrong - normal nodes are a light blue... not the blue depicted in the legend. Online nodes should be a similarly light faint red. Make the project and system entry color as they are in the graph. There is no distinction between a batch and an online project (non-sensical to make this separate).\
Also, when clicking online, all nodes but the system node should disappear (in it's current state where there appear to be no online learned insights) - current behavior: you ju...

**User Message:** loading /memory-online.json might be the wrong way of doing this. There is a logic with these files in that different teams/topics have separate times (ReSi, RaaS, UI, coding, ...). Having a central memory-online.json is wrong as it doesn't appear to make this distinction. What should happen is that, when an online learned topic is transferred to the corresponding json it needs to be attributed to the currently configured team. The default view is controlled by env variable # Default knowledge v...
