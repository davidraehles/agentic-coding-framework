note bottom of mcp
  **MCP Servers** provide:
  • Standardized tool definitions
  • Bi-directional communication
  • Resource and prompt support
end note

note right of core
  **Core Systems** use integrations for:
  • Deep code analysis (Semantic)
  • AST-based navigation (Serena)
  • Quality enforcement (Monitor)
