git --> analysis : Commit data
analysis --> ukb : Extracted insights
ukb --> storage : Knowledge graph updates
storage --> backups : Automated backups

storage --> vkb : Read memory data
vkb --> server : Start/manage server
server --> visualizer : Serve graph data
visualizer --> browser : Interactive visualization

claude <--> mcp : MCP operations
mcp <--> storage : Sync operations
claude --> ukb : Trigger knowledge capture

note right of storage : Authoritative data source\nGit-tracked for team sharing
note right of visualizer : Interactive D3.js graph\nColor-coded by entity type
note right of mcp : Persistent memory\nCross-session knowledge
